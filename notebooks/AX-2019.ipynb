While you are welcome to build a full network from scratch, most of you will not have sufficient access to the data and compuational power required, so you are welcome to provide a solution based on transfer learning from a pre-trained network, adapted to your new task. \n","\n","The Keras documentation has some examples of pretrained networks which are easy to integrate, see for example  their ResNet50 example [https://keras.io/applications/#classify-imagenet-classes-with-resnet50](https://keras.io/applications/#classify-imagenet-classes-with-resnet50), or the InceptionV3 network  [https://keras.io/applications/#fine-tune-inceptionv3-on-a-new-set-of-classes](https://keras.io/applications/#fine-tune-inceptionv3-on-a-new-set-of-classes). If you use the pretrained model, a good way to start is by freezing all layers up to the last layer before the output. Adapt the output layer to fit your classification problem. You might then unfreeze some earlier layers for further fine tuning.\n","\n","You will need to create a training set (at least 100 images per class, potentially classifying e.g type of location, activity. If you are training a full network from scratch you would need orders of magnitude more, but this will work for transfer learning on an existing network). It might be sensible to start off testing and demonstrating your approach by using an existing dataset e.g. \n","the [flowers one](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). You can find other interesting datasets at:\n","*   [http://deeplearning.net/datasets](http://deeplearning.net/datasets/)  \n","*   [UCI ML collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)\n","*   [https://www.visualdata.io](https://www.visualdata.io)\n","*   [https://ai.google/tools/datasets](https://ai.google/tools/datasets/ )\n","\n","Students who put more effort into creating and analysing an interesting dataset will tend to do better in marks for sections 1. & 2. below.\n","\n","Write a pre-processing step that will resize and crop the images to the right size ((224, 224) is default for ResNet50 and (299,299) is the default for Inception), and consider how you can apply data augmentation techniques to your new dataset, and design appropriate pre-processing functions.\n","\n","In your submission you should have the following structure (share of the AX marks given in brackets at the end of each part):\n","\n","1.   Analysis of the problem. (15%)\n","2.   Visualisation and analysis of the data type, quality and  class distributions. You may want to design some data augmentation in your system. (20%)\n","3.   Creation of multiple candidate network architectures. Include your justification of the design decisions. You should inlcude one very simple baseline model (e.g. a linear model, or a simple two layer Densely connected model). (15%)\n","4.   Training. This should include code for hyperparameter search, regularisation methods. (15%)\n","5.   Empirical evaluation of performance, and potentially visualisation and  analysis of the trained network. This should make good use of graphs and tables of results, confusion matrices etc to represent the relative performance of the different models.  Explain why you chose the metrics you use. (20%)\n","6.   Report on the performance, discussing the suitability of the final network for use. (15%)\n","\n","For each of the design decisions, make sure you describe in detail the motivation behind them. \n","\n","**Submission process**\n","\n","You should submit the colab notebook with *all* code needed to run your model and all visualisations of results in place (I don't want to have to run 80 projects :-) ). This exercise must be submitted as a colab notebook. Deadline Monday the 4th of March, 15:00.
